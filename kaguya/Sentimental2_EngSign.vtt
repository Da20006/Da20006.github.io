00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:12.780
You and I, are surely feeling the same way right now.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.220
When you smile at me,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.020
I feel as if an angel has descended down to me.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.060
Have you discovered out how I feel?  I better test you now...

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.860
...by using tricks and bargains,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.980
because soon there will be no escape.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.820
Are you ready for my challenge?

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.100
Now bring it on! Show me your embarrassed face!

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.060
And at the very end, say this to me...

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.100
..."I love you".

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.700
If it's you and I, in what way will we fall into love?

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.700
Let's figure out our relationship!

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.220
There’s no margin for error because every time you look at me...

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.060
...I can’t help but tremble!

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.780
I can't be honest with myself!
So take me with you already!

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.900
I’ve researched everything about you

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.780
Your hobbies, your thoughts, I've understood them all.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.860
All that's left to prepare is the timing and for it to look natural.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.700
Show to me the parts that have been stained, so I can cut them away for you

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.340
Now show me your conviction!

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.740
By saying what has been on both our minds!

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.900
Say that there is a string that connects us by fate!

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.660
Say it to me right now!

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.260
It’s so bright that it's hard to see,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.340
because I am surrounded by a pure white halation.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.860
I don't care if you say it modestly, or in a roundabout way!

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.940
As long as you say it...

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.980
...in your own special way...

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.580
...before I cry.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.340
Even though we want to say these words,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.380
why won't they leave our lips?

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.300
"It's not fair that I've been waiting all this time for you!"

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.700
After whispering these words, I finally understand.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:16.220
If it's you and I, in what way will we fall into love?

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.220
Let's figure out our relationship!

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.660
There’s no margin for error, because every time you look at me...

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.740
I can’t help but tremble!

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.460
I just can't be honest!
So take me with you already!

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:50.344
<c.red>This is how I feel about you.</c>
